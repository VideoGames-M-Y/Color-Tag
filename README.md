The familiar and beloved children's game - now in computer form

A game in which there is a catcher and the other participants are the chased, the player can join the game as a catcher or as the chased.

The catcher announces a color and all the other participants have to run and touch something of the same color so that they can be safe from the catcher. When everyone starts running and looking for the desired color, the catcher tries to catch a participant who has not yet touched the color.

Each stage of this game is located in a different place so that the level of difficulty increases with each stage.
